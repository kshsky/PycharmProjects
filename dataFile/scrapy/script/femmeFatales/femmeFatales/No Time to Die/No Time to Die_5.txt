我是布朗克斯人
I'm from the Bronx.
那就是我这么厉害的原因
And that was just me being nice.
安吉尔确实说对了一件事
Angel was right about one thing.
比比将会名声大噪
Bebe is about to become more famous than ever
她现在已经夺走了安吉尔心心念念的美角
now that she has stolen Angel's juicy role
也就是疯狂凶杀案的唯一幸存者
as the lone survivor of a crazed killer.
而对于安吉尔...
As for Angel, well...
她知道了所谓名声好坏只在一念间
she's learned the difference between fame and infamy.
生活就是这样 造化弄人
Life is such a bitch that way.
已经有一部关于她的电影在筹备中了
There's already a film about her in the works,
还有谣言说娜塔莉·波特曼将扮演她的角色
and rumor has it Natalie Portman is ready to kill for the part.
也许她能再得个奥斯卡奖
Perhaps she'll get another Oscar,
或许是最佳妆容奖
or maybe that honor will go to her makeup artist.
